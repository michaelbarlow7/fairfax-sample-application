# Sample Application for Fairfax

This is my sample application submission for Fairfax. 

- It uses standard Android MVVM
- It uses RetroFit to make just a single API call, with an RxJava adapter to sanitize the web-request somewhat.
- It's written entirely in Kotlin
- It uses Koin for dependency injection, since using Dagger with MVVM requires some boilerplate and Koin is adequate for a project of this size.
- Contains UI and unit tests.
- Uses Picasso for image-loading
